# ChatGPT-4 Photography Website Template
This project was created using ChatGPT-4, a large language model trained by OpenAI, and is intended to serve as a starting point for a photography portfolio website.

## How it works
To create this template, I asked ChatGPT-4 to create a website for me. It then asked me a series of questions about the desired look and feel of the website, 
the type of content to be featured, desired audience and other relevant details. Based on my inputs, ChatGPT-4 generated a basic HTML and CSS structure 
that can be used as a foundation for further customization. The first iteration of html and css it generated was okay. So I requested it to be tweaked a bit 
and I gave it a color palette that I wanted it to implement. Which I turned out to look good so I decided to keep it as my starting point. 

Chat-GPT has been all around social media lately so I wanted to mess around with it and see what I could create with the assistance of it. Believe it or not 
most of this README was genetrated by Chat-GPT. 

## Getting started
To use this template, simply download the files and start editing the HTML and CSS to fit your specific needs. You can add your own images, change the color 
scheme, and tweak the layout to create a unique website that reflects your personal style and showcases your photography.
